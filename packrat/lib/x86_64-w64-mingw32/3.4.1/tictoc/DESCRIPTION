Package: tictoc
Title: Functions for timing R scripts, as well as implementations of
    Stack and List structures.
Version: 1.0
Author: Sergei Izrailev
Maintainer: Sergei Izrailev <sizrailev@collective.com>
Description: This package provides the timing functions 'tic' and 'toc'
    that can be nested. One can record all timings while a complex
    script is running, and examine the values later. It is also
    possible to instrument the timing calls with custom callbacks. In
    addition, this package provides class 'Stack', implemented as a
    vector, and class 'List', implemented as a list, both of which
    support operations 'push', 'pop', 'first', 'last' and 'clear'.
