#' Assign seasons to SWMP sampling data
#' 
#' Assign seasons to SWMPr sampling data on a monthly basis or user-defined basis
#' 
#' @param data a vector of POSIXct dates
#' @param season A list of seasons. Months (1-12) are assigned to different groups based on user preference. Defaults to 12 months, starting with January. Must assign a minimum of two seasons
#' @param season_names A string vector of season names. The number of season names must match the length of the \code{season} list. A minimum of two seasons must be assigned (e.g., 'Wet', 'Dry'). Defaults to 12 months, starting with January. The number of season names must match the number of seasons
#' @param season_start defaults to 12 months, starting with January
#' @param abb logical, should abbreviations for month names be used? Defaults to \code{FALSE}

#' @details A helper function used by several data analyses to assign seasons to sampling data and to order the seasons. This function also allows the user to designate which season should be first.
#' 
#' @return Returns a vector of ordered
