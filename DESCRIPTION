Title: Functions for Analyzing and Plotting Estuary Monitoring Data
Version: 2.2.3
Maintainer: Kirk Waters <kirk.waters@noaa.gov>
Description: Tools for performing routine analysis and plotting tasks with environmental
    data from the System Wide Monitoring Program of the National Estuarine
    Research Reserve System <http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/>. This package builds
    on the functionality of the 'SWMPr' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=SWMPr>,
    which is used to retrieve and organize the data. The combined set of tools
    address common challenges associated with continuous time series data
    for environmental decision making, and are intended for use in annual reporting activities.
